# Blacksmith

Blacksmith creates a way to deploy data services on-demand via the Open Service Broker API, providing app developers on-demand and dedicated deployments of data services.

Blacksmith uses forges, community packs that instruct Blacksmith how to deploy a specified service. These are cookie-cutter templates, which are replicable and scalable. By automatically creating and binding the data services to the cloud app, app developers are free to focus on their product more, and operators aren't burdened by having to constantly spin services.

Stay tuned!
